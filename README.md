**MOTIVATION**
* Few questions your emotion classification model can answer based on your users review
  * What is the sentiment of yours?
  * What is the mood of today's?
* We would like to work on an emotion detection model using Keras and convolution neural networks, We are also using OpenCv to test our model.
* DEEP LEARNING: Deep learning is the machine learning technique that teaches computers to do Naturally to humans: learn by example.
